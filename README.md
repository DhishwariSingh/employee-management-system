## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Java 21
- Maven
- MySQL (create a database, e.g., `employee_db`)

### Getting Started

###Clone the Repository
```
git clone <repository-url>
cd employee-management-system
```
Configure `application.properties`

Add these in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

```properties
spring.application.name=employee-management-system
# Database configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/employeedb
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password

# Hibernate (JPA) settings
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true

# Server
server.port=8080
```

### Build and Run the Application

mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run

### Testing the Application

Use Postman or similar tools to test APIs.
Validate database entries via MySQL Workbench or CLI.

### Future Enhancements

1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) : Implement Admin, Manager, and Employee roles with varying access levels (using Spring Security and JWT).

2. Department & Address: Support sub-departments, multiple address types, and multiple addresses per employee.

3. Swagger: Improve API documentation with versioning, detailed descriptions, and mock responses.

4. Security: Implement JWT authentication, OAuth2 login, role-based access, and 2FA.

5. System: Add email notifications, bulk import/export, i18n, audit logging, cloud storage, and Docker support.

6. Error Handling: Improve error handling with custom exceptions and global handling using @ControllerAdvice.

7. Frontend: Build a responsive UI, employee dashboard, real-time updates, and advanced search/filter.
